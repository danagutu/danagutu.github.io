**Portfolio wesbite**

Hi there,

Glad to see you!

I'm junior software engineer with one year of experience in software development and deployment. If you're curious about my projects, browse through my personal website or my GitHub account.

My portfolio is currently a work in progress and it's intended to showcase my experience with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Firebase and R. I'll also be speaking about my internships, learning journey and all things tech and data that fascinate me.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can email me at danagutu2002@gmail.com.
